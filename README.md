# Open Source Issues - CSOC Dev Week 4 Assignment

We have compiled a list of issues for you to start solving. But before heading on to the list, here are some guidelines to be followed.

### Guidelines

* In general, whenever you come across any interesting project you would like to work on, it is better to start by reading the **README.md** and **CONTRIBUTING.md** (if present) files of the repository. 
    * __README.md__ gives you a basic idea about the project.
    * __CONTRIBUTING.md__ provides a short guide to how you can contribue to the project and lists guidelines you need to follow before making a PR. 

* Before starting with any issue, ask the mentor if the issue is still relevant to the project and if anyone is working on the same issue. You can start by simply writing that you are interested in solving the issue. 

* If the issue is not clear, then it is preferable to discuss the issue with the mentor before coming to any conclusion and starting the work.

* If your pull request is merged for the issue, then the points for that issue will directly be alloted to you. Collect as many points as you can to win exciting goodies!

> **_NOTE:_** Regarding this assignment, 
> * We will be assigning issues on FCFS basis, and each issue will be assigned to one person generally (there may be exceptions though :P).
> * Moreover, in case of delay, the issue will be open for anyone who will be willing to work on the issue.
